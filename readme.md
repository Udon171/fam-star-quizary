- **Main Game Concept**: [View Wireframe Concept (PDF)](docs/FamStarQ%20Concept.pdf)
- **Setup Menu Concept**: [View Wireframe Concept (PDF)](docs/FamStarQ%20Setup%20Game%20Concept.pdf)

Wireframes outline the initial design for the game interface, including player setup, question display, and round transitions. These were created using Microsoft Visio for clarity and structure.

## Design Choices
The design aims to replicate a TV game show experience with vibrant visuals, intuitive navigation, and immersive effects:
- **Layout**: Central question display with player buzzers and profile icons for clear visibility.
- **Animations**: Curtain transitions, animated lights, and countdown timers to enhance immersion.
- **Interactivity**: Simplified setup process and interactive buzzers for ease of use.
- **Theme**: Bright, bold colours and game show-inspired elements to appeal to a wide audience, particularly younger players.

## Typography
- **Primary Font**: *Roboto* (Google Fonts) for its clean, modern look and readability across devices.
- **Secondary Font**: *Bebas Neue* (Google Fonts) for headings and titles to convey a bold, game show vibe.
- **Font Sizes**: 
  - Headings: 24â€“36px for prominence.
  - Body text: 16â€“18px for readability.
  - Buttons and buzzers: 18â€“20px for clarity.
- **Font Weights**: Regular (400) for body text, Bold (700) for headings and emphasis.

## Colour Scheme
Two colour palette options were considered to evoke a vibrant, game show atmosphere:
- **Style A**: Bright and bold with gold (#FFD700), red (#FF0000), blue (#1E90FF), and black (#000000) accents. [View Palette](docs/Fam-star-quizary-pallete-A.png)
- **Style B**: Softer tones with pastel blue (#87CEEB), pink (#FF69B4), and cream (#FFF8DC) for a friendlier feel. [View Palette](docs/Fam-star-quizary-pallete-B.png)
- **Chosen Palette**: Style A was selected for its energetic, TV show-inspired aesthetic, appealing to a younger demographic.

### Entry 5: Pre-Programming Path
- Selected HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for development.
- Focused on user experience goals: intuitive setup, immersive gameplay, and clear feedback.
- Used projects in github for build goals

### Entry 6: Development Insight
- Change of prioriatise using Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Princables

Starting out I had my project section of github loaded with my planned development path. 
One thing I wanted to implement (but couldn't) was the tick box for the inner content which would have helped after using MVP pricables. Regardless, I used the project section of github, to manage the extra tasks from the basic, for a working product. The first complication of having 4 players over a one player setup were easy to see, needed a redirection to the one player setup.

This was then followed by a complete overlook at some features of show elements and was cut from the current direction of the project. This brought it back to a handfull of my project titles and content to produce a functioning one player quiz with a settings page and a start page to work (this is reflected in my projects section). 
Looking online at other quiz's JS code through github to understand the natue of using the api also made me realize I can call the single api instead of pre 50 questions as researched prior(as shown above int he diary). Making the basic working site was rewarding in itself but was done for a timed deadline and still needs more work to style and add any missing elements. I did not expect any issues as I had the basic's working. 

- The re-direct of style for the application of CSS

With the quick help from inspiration of design I had a direction for the new basic build of the project. Getting the first pages done was a breeze and established the new look for the first time. With no hicups i moved on to the quiz page and applied the same style elements to the quiz with a few changes of timer location and other bits moving to a prevous page nothing too drastic. Once done the quiz was gone, but the style was almost there but no quiz. after trying some basic changes like changing z-index as well as otheres, I moved on to making element @important which fixed the none showing quiz section further adjustments to style to get the quiz completley right became a bit more of a challenge with sevral attempts to achive the final look (this included change of txt colour to name one).

### Final Adjustments, Testing, Resposiveness and Accessablity

A: After getting the base project completed to a working stage for pre hand in. Ive now had a second look at each page to refine and test this project build. See table below for list of adjustements of these pages.

Events of Testing/Refining   
First issue to get fixed a correct answer bug thathappenmed when leaving the timer to go to zero then revealing the answer in green. fixed by restricting the anwser function in quiz.js.  
Second issue, the end page for getting a score wasnt displaying a total score +. I renamed file to winner.html and used !important in css this fixed thos issues.  
Third issue, To make the score more competetive for playing the quiz i added a time bonus mode. Quicker anwsers get bigger scores. 
Fourth thing i realised the sick mode difficulty had no function as the api doesnt suppport sick mode. I created my specfic sick mode using hard questions from 3 catogarys Maths, Science & Technology with just 15sec to answer felt good to me and after checking the api i made my sick mode option.  
After all this problem solving it came to a solid run of commits but nothing changed on the pages website hhhhmmmm why 3 weeks old i said hhhmmm. I removed the pages entry to then re upload the pages entry this has corrected all issues (mainly expired issue).  

### C: Resposive & Accesablility
600 or 768 for mobile?  
Mobile hept a vertical look filling the screen some titles need top space,the quiz need all answers resized to be visible.  
1080px issue with settings heading off screen adjusted via @media 1080 adding space to top of H1.  
All buttons were made effect reactive to offer visual direction. early disision to use green fill for correct and red for wrong but I added the wobble for easy visiual selecting keeping the visual inputs fast for question time.
